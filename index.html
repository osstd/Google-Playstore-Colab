        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          App and review data was scraped from the Google Play Store by Lavanya
          Gupta in 2018. Original files listed
          <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps">here</a

        <h2>Data Manipulation</h2>
        <p>
          To begin, we will read in the dataset from a .csv file into a Pandas
          dataframe. We will then inspect the first and last few rows of the
          data to get a sense of its structure and content. Next, we will
          examine the dimensions of the dataframe, including the number of rows
          and columns, and count the number of entries in each column. We will
          also remove any duplicates or unused columns.
        </p>

          <li>Read in the dataset from a .csv file</li>
          <li>Inspect the first and last few rows of the data</li>
          <li>Examine the dimensions of the dataframe</li>
          <li>Count the number of entries in each column</li>
          <li>Remove any NaN values present</li>
          <li>
            Check and eliminate any duplicate rows using
            <code>.duplicated()</code> and <code>.drop_duplicates()</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            Remove the columns called Last_Updated and Andriod_Version from the
            DataFrame

        <p>
          To generate a list of the top 10 most common app categories in the
          dataset. The <code>.value_counts()</code> function counts the number
          of occurrences of each unique value in the 'Category' column, and the
          <code>[:10] </code> slicing operation selects only the top 10 most
          frequent categories. The result is stored, providing a list of the 10
          most popular app categories in the dataset. The results is shown using
          a vertical bar plot on the following figure.

          first grouped by the 'Category' column using <code>.groupby()</code>,
          then the sum of the 'Installs' column is calculated for each group
          using the <code>.agg()</code> function. The resulting data is then
          sorted in ascending order based on the number of installs, with the
          category with the fewest downloads appearing first. The following
          figure shows the final horizontal plot for each category.

          in every category, there are significantly more free apps downloaded
          than paid apps, indicating a strong preference for free apps across
          all categories.

        <h2>Plotly Box Plots: Lost Downloads for Paid Apps</h2>
        <p>
          Utilzing Plotly's box plot function to visualize the number of
          installs for free and paid apps. The resulting plot reveals a striking
          difference in the median number of installs between the two
          categories, with free apps having a median of 500,000 installs and
          paid apps having a median of just 5,000 installs. This disparity
          suggests a significant loss of potential for paid apps, highlighting a
          potential opportunity for growth and optimization in the paid app
          market.

          The following figure displays box plots of paid apps in each category,
          showing the distribution of revenue for apps in that category. The
          median revenue for apps in each category is highlighted, revealing
          insights into the earning potential of apps in different categories.
          For example, the median app in the Tools category earns approximately
          $6,000. Notably, Photography apps earn around $57,000 on average,
          which exceeds the assumed development cost of $30,000, indicating that
          these apps are likely to recoup their development costs and
          potentially generate profits.

          This final plot compares the actual prices of paid apps across
          categories, revealing insights into pricing strategies. The median
          price of all paid apps is $2.99, but notable variations exist across
          categories. Business, Dating, and Medical apps have higher median
          prices, while Personalization, Video Players, and News & Magazines
          apps have lower median prices, indicating different monetization
          approaches across categories.
